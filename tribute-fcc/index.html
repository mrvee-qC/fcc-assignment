        <center><p>Lawrence Gordon Tesler (April 24, 1945 – February 16, 2020) was an American computer scientist who worked in the field of human–computer interaction. Tesler worked at Xerox PARC, Apple, Amazon, and Yahoo!</p>

            <p>While at PARC, Tesler's work included Smalltalk, the first dynamic object-oriented programming language, and Gypsy, the first word processor with a graphical user interface for the Xerox Alto. During this, along with colleague Tim Mott, Tesler developed the idea of copy and paste functionality and the idea of modeless software. While at Apple, Tesler worked on the Apple Lisa and the Apple Newton, and helped to develop Object Pascal and its use in application programming toolkits including MacApp.</p></center>
            <br>
            <center><ul>
               <li> <b>The scientist</b> was born in the Bronx, New York, in<b> 1945</b>, and worked in the genesis stage of computers in the <b>1960s</b>, aiming to make them more accessible and intuitive.</li>

               <li><b>He</b> specialised in <b>user interface design</b> and is most famous for devising the <b>cut<b> and</b> paste </b>command alongside his colleague Tim Mott at Parc. It updated the old method of editing in which people would<b> physically cut portions of printed text </b>and glue them elsewhere.</li>

               <li><b>The command</b> was incorporated into <b>Apple’s software</b> on the<b> Lisa computer</b> in 1983 and on the <b>original Macintosh </b>the following year.</li>

               <li> <b>A young Jobs</b> visited Parc in 1974 and was shown around by Tesler. The scientist <b>showed the future Apple </b>boss the firm’s prototype Alto personal computer and moved the <b>cursor</b> across the screen with the aid of a “mouse”.</li>

               <li> Whereas directing a computer had previously meant typing a command on the keyboard, Tesler just clicked on one of the icons on the screen. He recalled: “Steve started jumping around the room, shouting, ‘Why aren’t you doing anything with this? This is the greatest thing. This is revolutionary!’” He also introduced the scroll bar on the Macintosh computer.</li>

               <li>Silicon Valley’s Computer History Museum said Tesler “combined computer science training with a counterculture vision that computers should be for everyone”.</li>

               <li>One of his strongest principles was that computer systems should stop using “modes”, which allow users to switch between functions on software and apps but make computers time-consuming and complicated. His website was even called “nomodes.com”, his Twitter handle was “@nomodes”, and his car registration plate also read “No Modes”.</li>

               <li>In a 2012 interview with the BBC, he spoke of the culture at Silicon Valley. He said: “There’s almost a rite of passage. After you’ve made some money, you don’t just retire, you spend your time funding other companies.</li>

               <li>“There’s a very strong element of excitement, of being able to share what you’ve learned with the next generation.”</li>
